                    <p class="y-tv">Dr. Muhammad Yunus, Nobel laureate, recently outlined his vision for a “Bangladesh
                        2.0,” emphasizing justice, human rights, and freedom of speech. Speaking at the 'Bay of Bengal
                        Conversation - 2024,' he highlighted the resilience of the nation following the historic July
                        uprising, which claimed 1,500 lives and led to the fall of the previous regime. Dr. Yunus
                        stressed the importance of rebuilding systems eroded by corruption, addressing economic
                        disparity, and tackling climate challenges. He urged international collaboration and praised the
                        youth's role in shaping the nation's future. The interim government, he stated, is committed to
                        establishing free, fair elections and rebuilding an inclusive, democratic society. Plans include
                        a memorial for uprising victims and reforms to ensure sustainable development.</p>
